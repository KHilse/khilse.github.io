		<p>I wrote this game as my first project in the immersive. The focus was to showcase proficiency in HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation, and Javascript. As a bonus I added an AJAX query to get current weather data using the OpenWeather API, so when you see clouds in the game, it means that the city you're defending is cloudy in real life!</p>
